This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Kotlin related to the handling of empty lists when using chained map and filter operations.  The bug arises when an empty list is passed through a sequence of transformations that expect non-empty collections.  The code produces an empty result silently which might lead to unexpected behavior in applications where it's not handled properly. The solution showcases a simple way to handle such scenarios to avoid unexpected behavior and improve code robustness.
